# musees_de_france_app

## About this GitHub repo

This is a small personal project consisting in showing data from the Museofile database, created by the French ministry of Culture and containing information about the museum having the label "Mus√©es de France". 

Obviously, data cleaning and preprocessing was the first step of this personal project. 

A the end, a Bokeh App was developped to show the data in a interactive way and with a "user-friendly" interface.
